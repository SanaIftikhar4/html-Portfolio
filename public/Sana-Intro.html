<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
    Hey there! I'm Sana, a mechanical engineer who has worked extensively as an HVAC design engineer, completing numerous projects specializing in creating heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems for multipurpose and high-rise buildings. I also have a passion for web development. Recently, I've started my journey as a web developer, eager to explore the world of digital creation. But there's more to me than just engineering.

  Outside of work, I cherish spending time with my wonderful family - my supportive spouse and our three amazing children.  Family is everything to me, We love to travel together, exploring new places and creating lasting memories.
